     <h2>Instructions</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>9x2-inch round cake pans. You can also use 9-inch springform pans</li>
       <p>
        <li><strong>For the crust:</strong> Combined the <strong>flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast</strong> in the bowl of stand mixer
            fitted with a dough hook attachment. You can use a hand mixer if you don't have one you will have to do this by hand.
            Give those ingredients a quick toss. <strong>Add warm water and 1/4 cup melted butter</strong> Make sure to use warm water, hot water will kill the yeast.
            Mix dough ingredients untill everything becomes moistend. Mix for 4-5 minutes.
         </li>
         </p>
        
         <li>Form dough into a ball. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with <strong>oilve oil</strong>
            and place dough inside, make sure all sides of the dough are coated in olive oil. Cover the bowl 
            and allow to rise in warm enviroment for 1-2 hours.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li>Lightly flour a large work surface. Gently punch dough down to remove any air bubbles
            and roll the dough into a large 15x12 rectangle. <strong>Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top 
            of the dough.</strong> Roll the dough lengthwise. Cut the log in half. Form two pieces of dough into
            balls and place back into your greased bowl and cover. Allow to rise in the refrigerator for 1 hour. 
        </li>
        </p>

        <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong> Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow to melt.
             Once melted add <strong>grated onion, oregano, salt, and red pepper flakes.</strong> Once the onion has 
             sligtly browned (about 5 mins) add <strong>garlic, tomatoes, and sugar.</strong>
             Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow to simmmer until it's frangrant, and thick (about 30 minutes).
             You'll have 2 and 1/2 cups of sauce. 
         </li>

         <p>
         <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit</li>   
        </p>
    
    
        <li><strong>Assemble the pizza:</strong> After the dough balls have risen in the refrigerator,they should be puffy.
            Keep one in the fridge as you work with the first one. Roll out the dough on a slightly floured work surface,
            working into a 12-in circle. Use a rolling pin as a guide place over a <strong>9X12-inch deep dish cake pan.</strong>
            Make sure it is nice and tight fitting inside the pan. Trim any excess dough off the edges with a small knife. Brush with 
            <strong>olive oil.</strong> Repeat for the second pizza. Fill each pizza <strong>1/2 of the cheese, pepperoni and bacon
            </strong> or your desired toppings. pour about <strong>1 and 1/4 cups of sauce evenly on top of each.</strong> If you don't 
            like it saucy reduce to 3/4 cup. Sprinkle each with <strong>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese.</strong>

        <p>
        <li>Place the cake pan on top of a large baking sheet, which will catch anything potentially spilling over the sides. <strong>Bake for 20-28 minutes</strong>
            or until crust is golden brown. When 15 minutes are left cover with aluminum foil to prevent heavy browning and uneven baking. 
            After baking place pizzas on wire rack for 10 minutes and allow to cool. Place any leftovers in airtight container and refrigerate for 
            up to 5 days. Reheat leftovers in a 300 degrees fahrenheit oven for 15-20 minutes.
